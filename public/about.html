<h1>Get To Know Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a 23 year old web developer born and raised in Toronto Canada. Since I was
  a young kid I've always had a keen interest in computers and how they work.
  that interest has now driven me to start my coding journey and i find myself
  falling in love with it as i learn about all the intricacies of the different
  languages and programs I have the pleasure of using.
</p>

<p>
  This is the start of my journey but i hope to eventually gain all the
  knowledge and tools deemed necessary in order to land a job in the tech
  industry.
